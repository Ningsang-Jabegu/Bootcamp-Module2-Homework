## Project Structure

- **HTML Files:**
  - `activities.html`: A table showcasing planned activities at each cliff.
  - `cliff.html`: A detailed page about the four unique cliffs.
  - `contact.html`: A contact form page with email, phone, and a random code verification system.
  - `index.html`: The homepage introducing California's greatest cliffs.

- **JavaScript Files:**
  - `digiclock.js`: Displays the current time, formatted in AM/PM with time zones.
  - `footer.js` : Dynamically generates footer content from JavaScript.
  - `full_page.js` : Based on which html page calls or includes this file as a src/source value, it dynamically generates header section, main section, parent section and footer section with unique main section content.
  - `header.js` : Generates header content.
  - `main.js` : Generates actual main content of the page, generates different content for different pages.
  - `partner.js` : Generates the whole partner section and parter's logo images dynamically without writing anything in html file.
  - `randomcodes.js`: Generates a random 8-character code for verification in the contact form and enables/disables the submit button based on code input.
  - `site_script.js`: Dynamically generates and displays a list of partner images from JavaScript.

- **CSS Files:**
  - `style.css`: Styles the entire website, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.

## Key Features

### 1. Digital Clock (`digiclock.js`)
This script displays the current local time on the homepage. The time is updated every second and is shown in 12-hour format with an appropriate time zone (PT, MT, CT, ET).

### 2. Random Code Generator (`randomcodes.js`)
- Generates a random code from a set of alphanumeric characters, including special symbols.
- This code is displayed in the contact form.
- The user must enter the correct code to enable the "Inquire" button.

### 3. Dynamic Partner List (`site_script.js`)
- Dynamically creates a list of partner images from JavaScript and adds them to the HTML `ul` element.
- The list of partners is displayed on the homepage under the "Our Partners" section.

### 4. Responsive Design
- The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and flexible layouts.
