  - `cliff_main.js` : Generates the main content of cliff page.
  - `contact_main.js` : Generates the main content of contact page.
  - `digiclock.js`: Displays the current time, formatted in AM/PM with time zones.
  - `footer.js` : Dynamically generates footer content from JavaScript.

  - `main.js` : Generates actual main content of the page, generates different content for different pages.
  - `partner.js` : Generates the whole partner section and parter's logo images dynamically without writing anything in html file.
  - `randomcodes.js`: Generates a random 8-character code for verification in the contact form and enables/disables the submit button based on code input.
  - `site_script.js`: Dynamically generates and displays a list of partner images from JavaScript.

- **CSS Files:**
  - `style.css`: Styles the entire website, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.

## Key Features

### 1. Digital Clock (`digiclock.js`)
This script displays the current local time on the homepage. The time is updated every second and is shown in 12-hour format with an appropriate time zone (PT, MT, CT, ET).

### 2. Random Code Generator (`randomcodes.js`)
- Generates a random code from a set of alphanumeric characters, including special symbols.
- This code is displayed in the contact form.
- The user must enter the correct code to enable the "Inquire" button.

### 3. Dynamic Partner List (`site_script.js`)
- Dynamically creates a list of partner images from JavaScript and adds them to the HTML `ul` element.
- The list of partners is displayed on the homepage under the "Our Partners" section.

### 4. Dynamic Main Section Content Generator (`activities_main.js`, `cliff_main.js`, `contact_main.js`, `home_main.js`)
- Dynamically creates the content of activities, cliff, contact and home pages of this site under the "main" tag, which also acts as a main content of the page.

### 5. Custom HTML Elements Generator (`html_tags.js`)
- This javascript file exports all the html tags used in this whole project, and can be added more HTML tags in future if necessary. This file can be imported and we can easily add attributes to the tags. Usage Eg. import using `import { section } from '../../html_tags.js';` and can be use as `const contactInfoSection = section({ className: "contactinfo" });` will create a section tag with the class `.contactinfo`.
